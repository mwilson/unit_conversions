Unit Conversions
================

This plugin installs a small table (unit_conversions), which will allow the user to easily and dynamically define unit conversions.

I put my cucumber test under features, but don't know how to test them without the full rails framework available.

Example
=======

Call this function:
UnitConversion.convert_units(units_in, units_out, result)

UnitConversion.convert_units('ppm', 'ppb', 456) = 456000
